        <h2>üéì More about myself:</h2>
        <p >
          I am an 18 year-old incoming first year college student entering Stevens Institute of Technology under the 5 year program to receive my Masters of Science in Computer Science. 
          Computer science allows me to explore my interests and passions of computational physics, complex mathematical simulations, and focus on a concentration in 
          artificial intelligence and machine learning.
        </p>

        <p >
          In terms of programming experience, I am extremely interested in low-level programming with C & C++, but also object-oriented programming with Java. 
          I also have web-development experience with React.js, Vite.js, and the HTML/CSS/JS stack. In terms of backend development I mainly use Node.js with 
          the Node Package Manager (NPM). However as of currently, C/C++/Java are my goto languages, and I enjoy low-level, performance driven code. Future 
          endeavors include learning Python to solve calculus and physics questions.
        </p>

        <p >
          I am about 95% self taught in all aspects and skills I have acquired throughout my life. As examples I have self-taught myself both Calculus 1 
          and Calculus 2 (referred to as AB & BC in highschool) throughout the summer of 2022 using <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> 
          and <a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/" target="_blank">Paul's Online Notes</a>. In terms of programming, well, my highschool never offered computer 
          science courses at all to my own surprise and I learned programming in Java on my own using online courses, the Java documentation, and projects that mainly deal with physics, 
          algorithms, etc. These projects helped me learn application development with GUI and regular UI libraries like Java Swing.
