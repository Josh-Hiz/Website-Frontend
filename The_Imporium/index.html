        <h2>üéì More about myself:</h2>
        <p >
          I am an 19 year-old upcoming sophomore college student at Stevens Institute of Technology under the 4 year program to receive my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, however, 
          I will be in the Accelerated Masters Program to receive my Masters degree in Computer science 1 year early. Computer science allows me to explore my interests and passions of 
          computational physics, complex mathematical simulations, and focus on a concentration in Artifical Intellgience and Machine Learning, all under the realm of Data Science and Analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          I currently work as a research assistant for <a href="https://mgree.github.io/" class="inline-link">Professor Michael Greenberg</a> at Stevens Institute of Technology and I am an Undergraduate Research Intern at Stevens Institute of Artificial
          Intelligence, SIAI. My work with Greenberg focuses on the development of Static web generation, creating a course website and WASM tools to aid in the development of graduate courses, starting with 
          CS-515: Intro to CS for graduate students these include. The tools I developed for it include both my Pyodide-WASM Python IDE to run coding challenges (similar to LeetCode) and my WASM-based REPL, 
          these were developed using JavaScript and ACE editor. The GitHub repository for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Josh-Hiz/SGBCourses" target="_blank" class="inline-link">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My work with SIAI is a lot more free and open-ended, my research is currently analyzing the growth in not only STEM but specifically research, engineering 
          and most notably Data Science Jobs within the U.S. utilizng the Burning Glass Database and SQL to access the data. I want to see if there was a net gain in 
          the demand for data science and machine learning development jobs and how big is this gain. After my analysis is done within Python and Jupyter Notebook, 
          it might be contributed to a publication but It's still in heavy development. I had actually started with the ONET Job task statement dataset and analyzed 
          the frequency of growing job tasks first as I wanted to learn how frequency analysis worked. However, it's accuracy can be scruitinized due to the lack of 
          overall data points ONET has supplied.
        </p>

        <p >
          In terms of programming experience, I am very interested in C & C++, but also object-oriented programming with Java. 
          I also have web-development experience with React.js, Vite.js, and the HTML/CSS/JS stack. In terms of backend development I mainly use Node.js with 
          the Node Package Manager (NPM). However as of currently, C++, Java, and Python are my goto languages. Future 
          endeavors include learning CUDA for optimized ML development with PyTorch or Tensorflow.
