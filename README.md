# Official Front-End to my portfolio Website

This is the offical code for the front-end of my website "The Imporium"

## What's in it?:

- Vite.js: A rapid development tool for modern web projects. It focuses on speed and performance by improving the development experience. It allows for greater ease in building smaller-scale, efficent web projects such as my portfolio website.
- Node JS and the NPM Package Manager: The NPM Package manager allows for my website to install libraries in order to create viusally appealing features. Most notably it allows me to use a library called three.js in order to easily program 3-Dimensional shapes and various other features as well as some other addons for better performance.  
- JavaScript: Main programming language used
